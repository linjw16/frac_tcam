## FracTCAM

This is an implementation of FracTCAM. Source file includes verilog example implementations of FracTCAM, exact table, longest prefix match table, and masked match table, along with some infrastructure and library modules. Testbench includes cocotb of most of the modules. 

I recommend to use fractcam.v as basic TCAM module. Comparing with the initial implementation, it provide backpressure mechanism for both search/match interfaces. The read/write logic for match rules are led out as conventional AXIL interface, the response delay are 32+1 and 32Ã—2+1 cycles separately. The buffer registers are moved from RAM32M output to and0 output to alleviate route delay. Nevertheless, there are still some timing performance defect and it would be modifying for a while.
